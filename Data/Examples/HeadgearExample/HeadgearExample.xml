	Begin defining our files to compile with this mod. Any Atlases, scripts, sounds, and other items must be directly referenced or referenced through a file here. 
	Our Builder executable will use this file to determine what you are trying to compile in your mod. If you have any unreferenced files, images, or other assets
	not referenced in here one way or another, it will skip them. Make sure you properly reference files to ensure everything is added correctly.
	We also need to keep the tags of the other asset types as the compiler expects to see them. Removing unused tags will result in an error!
