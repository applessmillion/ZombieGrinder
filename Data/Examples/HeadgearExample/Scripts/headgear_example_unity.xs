// This game loves to use what is known as 'unity' files, and you will too!
// Unity files are specifically for the purpose of defining new scripts you create for your mod.
// This allows you to call this one file instead of them all in the mod's main XML file.

using unity;					// This is the base-game unity file, which references EVERYTHING. You'll want to keep this so your mod compiles correctly. 
using item_example_headgear;	// Define our new script file name.
