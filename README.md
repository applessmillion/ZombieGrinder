Wowzers, a Zombie Grinder fork in 2024! What could this mean? Well, let's check out our master repository for README content then get to the edits!

# Zombie Grinder
Zombie Grinder was a local and online cooperative arcade game, with the primary aim of killing zombies. It supports a variety of game modes, items and features. It is currently available through Steam on Windows, Linux and MacOs.

At this point in time the project is on indefinite hiatus for various internal reasons. Due to that, the source is now available for those who wish to experiment with it.

No warrenty or documentation is available, if you contact me I may be able to give suggestions.

Please be aware, a lot of this was written when I was less experienced, there are many instanes of poor practice. So don't use this to learn :)

## License
The source code may be put to any use that is not commerical. Data assets are available in this responsitory as a courtesy to allow building the game, however we retain all rights, they should not be distributed.

## The edits

This repo will focus on the additon of new content to my private repo, ZombieGrinderV2. This will introduce new maps, new features, and other cool stuff I think would go well with the game.
Since this is legit the source of the game, there's a not-0% chance some of this might actually compile and work now!
